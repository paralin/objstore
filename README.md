# Object Store

> Object storage, caching, and encryption stack on top of pbobject and objectenc.

## Introduction

The object store manages storing and retrieving data from the local database (BadgerDB, IndexedDB) and the remote database (IPFS, js-ipfs).

Data is stored unencrypted in the local database, and encrypted in the remote database.
